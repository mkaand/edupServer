# Only listen to routers' LAN NIC.  Doing so opens up tcp/udp port 53 to
# localhost and udp port 67 to world:
interface=br0

# dnsmasq will open tcp/udp port 53 and udp port 67 to world to help with
# dynamic interfaces (assigning dynamic ips). Dnsmasq will discard world
# requests to them, but the paranoid might like to close them and let the 
# kernel handle them:
bind-interfaces

# Dynamic range of IPs to make available to LAN pc
dhcp-range=192.168.1.200,192.168.1.210,infinite

# If you'd like to have dnsmasq assign static IPs, bind the LAN computer's
# NIC MAC address:
dhcp-host=00:25:09:06:24:74,192.168.1.201
dhcp-host=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff,192.168.1.202
